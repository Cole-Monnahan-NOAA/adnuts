\usage{
check_identifiable(model, path = getwd())
}

}
\value{
Prints output of bad parameters and invisibly returns it.

\description{
Check identifiability from model Hessian
}
\details{
Read in the admodel.hes file and check the eigenvalues to
  determine which parameters are not identifiable and thus cause the
  Hessian to be non-invertible. Use this to identify which parameters
  are problematic. This function was converted from a version in the
  \code{FishStatsUtils} package.
