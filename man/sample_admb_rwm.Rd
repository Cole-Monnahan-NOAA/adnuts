\title{Run a single random walk Metropolis chain for an ADMB model}
\usage{
sample_admb_rwm(
  path,
  model,
  iter = 2000,
  thin = 1,
  warmup = ceiling(iter/2),
  init = NULL,
  chain = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  control = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  duration = NULL,
  extra.args = NULL,
  admb_args = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to model executable. Defaults to working
directory. Often best to have model files in a separate
subdirectory, particularly for parallel.}

\item{model}{Name of model (i.e., model.tpl)}

\item{iter}{The number of samples to draw.}

\item{thin}{The thinning rate to apply to samples. Typically not used
with NUTS.}

\item{warmup}{The number of warmup iterations.}

\item{init}{A list of lists containing the initial parameter vectors,
one for each chain or a function. It is strongly recommended to
initialize multiple chains from dispersed points. A of NULL signifies
to use the starting values present in the model (i.e., \code{obj$par})
for all chains.}

\item{chain}{Chain number, for printing purposes only.}

\item{seed}{Random seed to use.}

\item{control}{A list to control the sampler. See details for
further use.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean for whether to print ADMB output to console.}

\item{duration}{The number of minutes after which the model
will quit running.}

\item{admb_args}{Character string of extra command line argument to
pass to ADMB.}

A low level function to run a single chain. Unlikely to be used by a
