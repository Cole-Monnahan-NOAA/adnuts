\title{Draw MCMC samples from a model posterior using a static HMC sampler.}
\usage{
sample_tmb_hmc(
  iter,
  fn,
  gr,
  init,
  L,
  eps,
  warmup = floor(iter/2),
  seed = NULL,
  chain = 1,
  thin = 1,
  control = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{The number of samples to draw.}

\item{fn}{A function that returns the log of the posterior density.}

\item{gr}{A function that returns a vector of gradients of the log of
the posterior density (same as \code{fn}).}

\item{init}{A list of lists containing the initial parameter
vectors, one for each chain or a function. It is strongly
recommended to initialize multiple chains from dispersed
points. A of NULL signifies to use the starting values
present in the model (i.e., \code{obj$par}) for all chains.}

\item{L}{The number of leapfrog steps to take. The NUTS algorithm does
not require this as an input. If \code{L=1} this function will perform
Langevin sampling. In some contexts \code{L} can roughly be thought of
as a thinning rate.}

\item{eps}{The step size. If a numeric value is passed, it will be used
throughout the entire chain. A \code{NULL} value will initiate
sampler_params of \code{eps} using the dual averaging algorithm during
the first \code{warmup} steps.}

\item{warmup}{The number of warmup iterations.}

\item{seed}{The random seed to use.}

\item{chain}{The chain number, for printing only.}

\item{thin}{The thinning rate to apply to samples. Typically
not used with NUTS.}

\item{control}{A list to control the sampler. See details for
further use.}
}
\value{
A list containing samples ('par') and algorithm details such as
  step size adaptation and acceptance probabilities per iteration
  ('sampler_params').
}
\description{
Draw MCMC samples from a model posterior using a static HMC sampler.
}
\details{
This function implements algorithm 5 of Hoffman and Gelman
  (2014), which includes adaptive step sizes (\code{eps}) via an
  algorithm called dual averaging.
