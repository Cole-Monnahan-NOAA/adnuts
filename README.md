The aim of 'adnuts' (pronounced A-D nuts) is to provide advanced MCMC sampling for 'TMB' and 'ADMB' models. For TMB models it uses the sparse NUTS (SNUTS; [@monnahan2025]) algorithm to decorrelate the posterior using the joint precision matrix. The R package 'tmbstan' (available on CRAN) provides an alternative for TMB which more closely links to Stan. Until the development of SNUTS, 'adnuts' was primarily used for ADMB models. For the foreseeable future SNUTS via 'adnuts' is likely to be the best general option for TMB users.

For ADMB it mimics 'Stan' in functionality and feel, specifically providing no-U-turn (NUTS) sampling with adaptive mass matrix and parallel execution. Development of ADMB features is winding down, but functionality expected to be maintained in the coming years.

See the following paper for an introduction to the package capabilities, and contrast with tmbstan:

## Installation

To use SNUTS with TMB the development version must be installed, as well as the [StanEstimators](https://github.com/andrjohns/StanEstimators) package which is not on CRAN but can be installed as:

```         
# we recommend running this is a fresh R session or restarting your current session
install.packages('StanEstimators', repos = c('<https://andrjohns.r-universe.dev>', '<https://cloud.r-project.org>'))
```

The development version of 'adnuts' **is required for SNUTS functionality** and will be submitted to CRAN upon acceptance of the SNUTS paper. `devtools::install_github('Cole-Monnahan-NOAA/adnuts', ref='dev')`

A very basic example can be run as:

```         
library(adnuts)
TMB::runExample('simple')
mcmc <- sample_snuts(obj)
```

A brief [demonstration file](https://github.com/Cole-Monnahan-NOAA/adnuts/blob/dev/inst/demo_SNUTS.R) is the best place to help get you started, and there is also a user guide: see `vignette('adnuts')` for more detailed information.

## ADMB Installation and Usage

As of July 2025 package 'adnuts' is primarily designed for TMB models and sampling with the sparse NUTS algorithm. ADMB functionality still exists and how to install and use it can be found below.

The adnuts R package version 1.1.2 can be installed from CRAN: `install.packages('adnuts')`. Future minor releases [listed here](https://github.com/Cole-Monnahan-NOAA/adnuts/releases) may not be released on CRAN so the latest stable version can be installed as:

`devtools::install_github('Cole-Monnahan-NOAA/adnuts')`

The `sample_rwm` and `sample_nuts` functions draw posterior samples from an ADMB model using an MCMC algorithm (random walk Metropolis or no-U-turn sampler). The returned fitted object contains samples and other information. The function 'extract_samples' can be used to get posterior samples (post warmup and thinning) into a data frame for inference, while 'launch_shinyadmb' can be used for interactive diagnostics based on 'ShinyStan'.

A brief [demonstration file](https://github.com/Cole-Monnahan-NOAA/adnuts/blob/master/inst/demo_ADMB.R) is the best place to help get you started, and there is also a user guide: `vignette('adnuts')` for more detailed information.

'adnuts' was designed specifically for use in ADMB fisheries 'stock assessments, and interested authors are referred to:

Monnahan, C.C., T.A. Branch, J.T. Thorson, I.J. Stewart, C.S. Szuwalksi (2020) Overcoming long Bayesian run times in integrated fisheries stock assessments. ICES Journal of Marine Science. <https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsz059>

## ADMB Installation

To use the ADMB functionality you need to build your model with version 12.0 (released December 2017) or later, otherwise this functionality is not available. See [the ADMB installation instructions](https://www.admb-project.org/docs/install/) for more information. ADMB 12.2 is highly recommended because it provides better console output, fixes bugs, and adds improved adaptation capabilities as compared to 12.0. You can check the ADMB version of a compiled model from the command line with a command `model.exe -version` which prints the version among other things.

## Known issues

Windows users may experience issues if their model name is too long. In some cases the OS will rename the output files using a "short" version. You'll see files like "MODEL\~1.par". The package tries to handle this but it is **highly recommended** to simply shorten your filename. So instead of 'model_filename_2021.tpl' use e.g. 'model_21'.

Analyses are reproducible by setting the same initial values and a seed in `sample_rwm` or `sample_nuts` (passed to ADMB as '-mcseed'). However, they may not be entirely consistent across OS platforms. The chains will start the same but may eventually diverge. This is likely due to minuscule differences in the gradient and log-posterior calculations between systems and compilers.
