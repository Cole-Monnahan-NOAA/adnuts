## Summary

`adnuts`' (pronounced A-D NUTS like A-D MB) main purpose is to
provide a wrapper for performing Bayesian analyses using the
no-U-turn (NUTS) algorithm [@hoffman2014] for TMB
[@kristensen2016] and ADMB [@fournier2012] models. 

For TMB models the NUTS algorithm is in the Stan software
[@carpenter2017] and linked through the
[StanEstimators](https://github.com/andrjohns/StanEstimators) R
package. `adnuts` implements the sparse NUTS (SNUTS) algorithm of
[@monnahan2025] by decorrelating and descaling the posterior
distribution prior to passing to Stan. For models with high
correlations and sparse precision matrices, SNUTS can
substantially improve sampling efficiency. For models without
strong global correlations, the related package `tmbstan` is
likely to be faster due to lower overhead and may be a better
option. Eventually, Stan may include SNUTS functionality and in
that case `tmbstan` may be a better long term option. For TMB
users now, SNUTS via `adnuts` is likely to be the best overall
package for Bayesian inference. Importantly, it works for TMB and
RTMB models, and can be run on TMB models from existing packages.

ADMB models contain the algorithm code internally, but this
package provides the user a convenient environment to run and
diagnose Markov chains, and make inference. Development for ADMB
models is frozen but should maintain backwards compatibility in
the near future. This package aims to give ADMB models similar
functionality to the software Stan and `rstan` in particular
[@carpenter2017; @stan2017].

## History
The package has undergone several shifts in focus. Initially, it
was developed to provide a NUTS implementation for models where
the log-density and log-density gradient could be written as R
functions (e.g., TMB). However, the `tmbstan` package was
developed and became the preferred option for TMB users, so the
focus switched to ADMB models and TMB functionality was
de-emphasized. Now, with the development of SNUTS, the primary
focus of `adnuts` is for TMB sampling via the SNUTS approach.
