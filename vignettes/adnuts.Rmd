## Summary

`adnuts` main purpose is to provide a wrapper for performning Bayesian
analyses using the no-U-turn (NUTS) algorithm [@hoffman2014] for ADMB
models [@fournier2012]. The ADMB model itself contains the algorithm code,
but this package provides the user a convenient environment to run and
diagnose Markov chains, and make inference. In addition, NUTS capabilities
are provided for any posterior whose log-density and log-density gradient
can be written as R functions. This includes TMB models [@kristensen2016]
but also other special cases. This package aims to give ADMB and TMB models
similar functionality to Stan [@carpenter2017; @stan2017].

Key features of the packages:

- Run no-U-turn sampler or random walk Metropolis MCMC chains from within R
  using the `sample_admb` and `sample_tmb` functions.
- Adaptation of the NUTS stepsize is automatically done during the warmup phase.
- The mass matrix options are: diagonal adaptation during warmup or an
  arbitrary dense matrix can be passed from R.
- Parallel execution and automatic merging of chains ease workflow.
- Easy diagnostic checking using functionality provided by packages `rstan`
  and `shinystan`.

Additional features for ADMB users:

- The MLE covariance matrix can be used (i.e., ADMB file
  admodel.cov). Likewise, the model can be initialized from the '.par' file
  (although not recommended).
- A 'duration' argument to stop the chains running after a specified period
  of time (e.g., 2 hours), returning whatever samples were generated in
  that period.
- When running multiple chains, whether in parallel or serial, samples are
  merged and written to the '.psv' file. Thus, executing the model in the
  '-mceval' phase uses all chains. `sample_admb` includes an 'mceval'
  argument dictating whether to run in this phase when the sampling is
  finished.
- A modified pairs plot designed to help facilitate comparison between MLE
  estimates and covariances, and the posterior samples.

Typically NUTS works efficiently with default settings and no user
intervention. However, in some cases you may need to modify the
settings. See below for a brief description of NUTS and how you can modify
its behavior and when needed.

Guidance and performance specifically designed for fisheries stock
assessment is given in [@monnahan2019].

## Sampling for ADMB models
### Setting up the model

In general very little is needed to prepare an ADMB model for use with
`adnuts`. As with any model, the user must build the template file to
return a negative log likelihood value for given data and parameters. The
user is responsible for ensuring the a valid and reasonable model is
specified. Typical model building practices such as building complexity
slowly and validating with simulated data are strongly encouraged.

### Sampling with sample_admb

Sampling for ADMB models is accomplished with the R function `sample_admb`.
This function is designed to be similar to Stan's `stan` function in naming
conventions and behavior. Some differences are necessary, such as passing a
model name and path. Also note that this function does not do optimization
nor Variational Inference.

The default behavior for NUTS is to run 3 chains with 2000 iterations, with
a warmup (i.e., burn-in) phase during the first 1000. There is no external
thinning (in a sense it is done automatically within the algorithm), and
thus the `-mcsave` option does not work with NUTS by design. These defaults work well
in most cases and should be changed only after running chains and
investigating. Users of the RWM algorithm will accustomed to running
millions of iterations with a high thinning rate. **Do not do that!**. The
key thing to understand is that NUTS runs as long as it needs to get nearly
independent samples. Consult the Stan documentation for advice on a
workflow for NUTS models (e.g.,
[this guide](http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/rstan_workflow.html))

`sample_admb` can also run RWM chains via the argument
`algorithm="RWM"`. Consult the ADMB documentation for more information on a
workflow with these samplers.

One important overlap with Stan the `control` arguments, which allows the
user to control the algorithm. For NUTS, this includes:
 - Metric or mass matrix (adapted digonal or dense matrix) [`metric`]
 - Maximum treedepth for trajectories [`max_treedepth`']
 - Target acceptance rate [`adapt_delta`]
 - Step size, which if NULL is adapted [`stepsize`]
 - Mass matrix adaptation tuning parameters (not recommended to change)
   [`w1`, `w2`, `w3`]

For RWM the only argument used is `metric`.

This function returns a list whose elements mimic some of that returned by
`stan` as well. `stan` returns an object of class `stanfit` while the
output of `sample_admb` is a simple named list. However, this list has been
constructed to be useful for plugging into some `rstan` tools (see below).

### mceval phase and posterior outputs

No special output files are required to run the model with `adnuts`. In
addition, the user can still use the `mceval_phase` flag to run specific
code on saved samples. ADMB saves posterior draws to a .psv file. When
executing the model with `-mceval` it will loop through those samples and
execute the procedure section with flag `mceval_phase()` evaluating
to 1. This behavior is unchanged with `adnuts`, but is complicated when
running multiple chains because there will be multiple .psv files. Thus,
`sample_admb` combines chains in R and writes a single .psv file containing
samples from all chains (after warmup and thinned samples are
discarded). This also works in parallel (see below).

Previously, ADMB required an estimated covariance function to use the
random walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm. Thus, for models without a valid
mode or a Hessian that could not be inverted could not use MCMC
methods. With `adnuts` neither an MLE nor covariance estimate is needed
because NUTS adapts these tuning parameters automatically (see
below). However, if a mode exists I recommend estimating the model normally
before running MCMC.

`sample_admb` is strongly recommended for running the MCMC (NUTS or
RWM). However, it is a convenience function that runs the chains from the
command line. The list returned by `sample_admb` contains an element `cmd`
which shows the user the exact command used to call the ADMB model.

The ADMB model is an executable file that contains the code necessary for
NUTS and RWM. When run, it generates many output files. As such, I
recommend putting the model into a subdirectory below the directory
containing the R script (passed as the `path` argument). This is required
for parallel execution but is recommended in general.

### Bounds & Priors

Parameter priors must be specified manually in the ADMB template file. For
instance, a standard normal prior on parameter `B` would be subtracted from
the objective as `f+=dnorm(B,0.0,1.0)`. Note that statistical functions in
ADMB, such as `dnorm`, return the negative log density and thus must be
added to the objective function.

Parameter transformations are limited to box constraints within the ADMB
template (e.g., `init_bounded_number`). When used, this puts an implicit
uniform prior on the parameter.

However, variance parameters are common and require bounds of (0, Inf). To
implement such a bound in ADMB, specify the model parameter as the log of
the variance, and then in the template exponentiate it and use
throughout. Because of this parameter transformation, the Jacbobian
adjustment is needed. This can be accomplished by subtracting the parameter
in log space from the negative log-likelihood. For instance, use parameter
`log_sd` in the template, then let `sigma=exp(log_sd)`, and update the
objective function: `f-=log_sd;`.


### Parallel sampling

Parallel sampling is done by brute force using the `snowfall`
package. `n.cores` chains will be run by making temporary copies of the
directory `path` (which contain the model executable, data inputs, and any
other required files). Then a separate R session calls `sample_admb` and
when done the results are merged together and the temporary folders
deleted. If errors occur, these temporary folders may need to be deleted
manually.

### Diagnostics and plotting results

```` {r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(adnuts)
## library(rstan)
fit.admb <- readRDS('fit.admb.RDS')
````
The `rstan` package provides an improved function for calculating effective
sample size and $\hat{R}$ statistics. The samples from the fitted object
can be plugged directly into it.

````{r}
mon <- rstan::monitor(fit.admb$samples, print=FALSE)
mon[1:4,'n_eff']
mon[1:4,'Rhat']
````

Likewise both the model parameters and the NUTS sampler parameters can be
extrated as a data frame. These functions have optional arguments for
whether to include the warmup samples and log posterior column (lp__)

````{r}
post <- extract_samples(fit.admb)
str(post[,1:5])
sp <- extract_sampler_params(fit.admb)
str(sp)
````

The list returned by `sample_admb` can also be plugged directly into the
ShinyStan interactive tool environment by calling the wrapper function
`launch_shinyadmb`. See ShinyStan documentation for more information on
this. It is designed to provide NUTS specific diagnostics, but also serves
as a more general tool for MCMC diagnostics and thus is beneficial for RWM
chains as well. If desired, the output samples can be converted into `mcmc`
objects for use with the CODA R package.  For instance, CODA traceplots can
be accessed like this:

```` {r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
post <- extract_samples(fit.admb, as.list=TRUE)
postlist <- coda::mcmc.list(lapply(post, coda::mcmc))
coda::traceplot(postlist)
````

Most ADMB models have well defined modes and estimated covariance matrices
used to quantify uncertainty. The `pairs_admb` function can be used to plot
pairwise posterior draws vs the MLE estimate and confidence ellipses. Major
discrepancies between the two are cause for concern. As such, this can be a
good diagnostic tool for both frequentist and Bayesian inference. In
particular, it often is informative to plot the slowest mixing parameters.

```` {r fig1, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5}
slow <-  c("sigmayearphi", "yeareffphi_raw[3]", "yeareffphi_raw[2]",
           "yeareffphi_raw[4]", "yeareffphi_raw[1]")
pairs_admb(fit.admb, pars=slow)
````

Here we see a large mismatch between the ellipses and MCMC samples. Thus,
even though ADMB found an MLE and succcessfully inverted the Hessian
matrix, its estimates are invalid. It is not surprise, as this is a complex
hierarchical model without a true mode. NUTS works efficiently for this
model because it does not use these MLE estimates. The standard RWM
algorithm would grind to a halt and never converge for this model, but NUTS
works well.

## Sampling for TMB models
### Setting up the model

Noting special needs to be done to setup a TMB object for use with
`sample_tmb`. Typically the Laplace Approximation is not done during MCMC,
and so by default the parameters declared as "random" are treated the
same. You can turn this off with the `laplace` option.

### Bounds & Priors

Box constraints can be passed directly to `sample_tmb` as vectors `lower`
and `upper` the same as to the optimizer. Values of -Inf and Inf are
allowed to create one-sided contraints, as with variance parameters. Note
that these parameter transformations are done in R and thus are relatively
slow. Alternatively variance parameters can be added to the template in log
space and a Jacobian adjustment added as in ADMB (see above).

### sample_tmb

Similar to `sample_admb` in its arguments, behavior, and returned
value. See above for more information.

### Parallel sampling

Parallel chains can be run using the `snowfall` package by specifying
`parallel=TRUE` and the number of cores. The TMB object needs to be rebuilt
because new R sessions are created. No console output is presented when
running in parallel, but text output is piped to a file for monitoring if
desired.

### Diagnostics and plotting results

Output returned from `sample_tmb` is very similar as from `sample_admb`, so
refer to those sections. But use `launch_shinytmb` for these objects.
There is no equivalent for `pairs_admb` for TMB models.

## Examples

````R
TMB::runExample("simple")
init <- function() list(mu=u, beta=beta, logsdu=0, logsd0=0)
fit <- sample_tmb(obj=obj, init=init)
post <- extract_samples(fit)
sp <- extract_sampler_params(fit)

````

## The no-U-turn sampler implementation

### Brief review of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is a powerful family of MCMC algorithms that use
gradients to propose efficient transitions. We review the basics here but
refer to interested readers to
[@neal2011; @betancourt2017intro; @monnahan2017]. Instead of randomly
generating a proposed point, to be rejected/accepted, HMC generates
*trajectories* from which a point is chosen to be rejected/accepted. These
trajectories use gradient information and an analogy of a ball rolling on a
surface is often used. These trajectories are efficient when they can
transition to nearly anywhere on the posterior (stark contrast with random
walk algorithms). However, to do this they need to be well-tuned. Generally
there are three aspects of the algorithms that need to be tuned.

 1. The step size. How big of steps between points on a single
    trajectory. Bigger steps means fewer calculations (and thus faster),
    but has a negative cost of rejecting more points.
 2. The trajectory length. How long should a trajectory should be depends
    on many factors, and is not constant over the posterior. If it is too
    short, HMC resembles inefficient random walk behavior. If it is too
    long, computations are wasted.
 3. The "mass matrix" used. This matrix tells the algorithm about the
    global shape of the posterior so that it can generate better
    trajectories. When large discrepancies between marginal variances
    exist, the trajectores will be less efficient (e.g., one parameter has
    a marginal variance of 1, and another a marginal variance of 1000).

The no-U-turn sampler is a powerful sampler because it automated the tuning
of the first two of these aspects [@hoffman2014]. During warmup it tunes
the step size to a target acceptance rate (default of 0.8) which has been
shown to be optimal [@betancourt2014]. Most importantly, though, is that it
uses a recursive tree building algorithm to continue doubling the
trajectory until a "U-turn" occurs, meaning going any further would be
wasteful computationally. Thus, trajectory lengths are automatically
optimal.

The original algorithm was implemented into the Bayesian statistical
software Stan [@carpenter2017; @stan2017]. In addition to the automation of
NUTS, Stan provides a scheme for adapting the step size during the warmup
phase. Estimated diagonal mass matrices correct for global differences in
scale, but not correlations. A dense matrix can also be adapted, and
corrects for global correlations, but comes at a higher computation
cost. Typically a diagonal matrix is best and thus is default in both Stan
and `adnuts`.

These three extensions lead to efficient HMC sampling with little to no
user intervetion for a wide class of statistical models, including
hierarchial ones [@monnahan2017]. Since publication, further developments
have been made in HMC theoretical and practical research. For instance,
Stan now includes an update called "exhaustive" HMC [@betancourt2016] that
more efficiently samples from the points in a trajectory.

### Algorithm implementation details

For both ADMB and TMB models, `adnuts` uses the original algorithm
presented in [@hoffman2014]. However it also uses a similar mass matrix
adaptation scheme as used in Stan.

The algorithm is initiated with a unit diagonal mass matrix. During
the first 50 iterations only the step size is adapted. After the next 75
iterations an estimated variance for each parameter (in untransformed
space) is calculated and used as the new mass matrix. The next update
occurs after twice the iterations as the previous update. This process
repeats until the last 25 samples of the warmup phase. During this phase
the mass matrix is held constant and only the step size adapt. See the Stan
manual [@stan2017] for more details. The step size is adapted during all
warmup iterations. No information is returned about mass matrix adapation
currently.

Once the warmup phase is over, no adaptation is done. Because of the
adaptation the warmup samples are not valid samples from the posterior and
*must* be discarded and not used for inference.

### User intervention

In some cases you will need to adjust the behavior of the NUTS algorithm to
improve sampling. Here I review the three options for intervention (step
size, trajectory lengths, mass matrix) that a user can take, and when and
why they might need to.

A maximum tree depth argument is used to prevent excessively long
trajectories (which can occur with poorly specified models). This is set to
12 (i.e., a length of $2^12=4096$ steps) by default, which typically is
long enough that a U-turn would occur. However, in some cases a model may
need to make longer trajectories to maintain efficient sampling. In this
case you will get warnings about exeeding maximum tree depth. Rerun the
model with `control=list(max_treedepth=14)` or higher, as needed.

Recall that a single NUTS trajectory consists of a set of posterior
samples, resulting from a numerical approximation to a path along the
posterior. The step size controls how close the approximation is along the
true path. When the step size is too large and encounters extreme curvature
in the posterior a divergence will occur. Divergences should not be ignored
because they could lead to bias in inference. Instead, you force the model
to take smaller step sizes by increasing the target acceptance rate. Thus,
when you get warnings about divergences, rerun the model with
`control=list(adapt_delta=.9)` or higher, as necessary. If the divergences
do not go away, investigate the cause and try to eliminate the extreme
curvature from the model, for example with a reparameterization
[@stan2017; @monnahan2017].

If there are extreme global correlations in your model, NUTS will be
inefficient when using a diagonal mass matrix (the default). In this case,
you can pass a dense matrix, estimated externally or from previous runs
(`sample_admb` returns an element `covar.est` which can be passed to the
next call). Do this with `control=list(metric=M)` where M is a matrix in
untransformed space that approximates the posterior. For ADMB models, you
can try using the MLE covariance by setting
`control=list(metric="mle"). Note that, for technical reasons, you need to
reoptimize the model with the command line argument `-hbf 1`. (ADMB uses
different transformation functions for HMC so the covariance would be
mismatched otherwise). Note that when using a dense mass matrix there is
additional computational overhead, particularly in higher dimensions. That
is, a dense matrix leads to shorter trajectories, but they take longer to
calculate.  Whether a dense metric is worth the increase in sampling
efficiency will depend on the model.

The following figure demonstrates the effect of the mass matrix on a 2d
normal model with box constraints. The columns denote the different model
"spaces" and the rows different mass matrices. Random, arbitrary NUTS
trajectories are show in red over the top of posterior draws (points). The
right column is the model space, the middle the untransformed, and the far
left the untransformed after being rotated by the mass matrix. Note the
differences in scales in the axes among plots. The key here is the
rightmost column. The top panel is with no mass matrix (i.e., unit
diagonal), and the trajectories ungulate back and forth as they move across
the posterior. Thus to go from one end to the other is not very
straight. When a diagonal matrix is used, the trajectories become
noticeably straighter. Finally, with the dense matrix the trajectories are
even better. This is the effect of the mass matrix: trajectories can move
between regions in the posterior more easily.
